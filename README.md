# 🚛 Heavy Goods Vehicle Navigation Data Reference 🧭

Hello,

this repository contains reference tools and datasets related to navigation workflows for **heavy goods vehicles (HGV)**.

The focus is on real-world operational constraints such as vehicle size, weight, routing limitations, parking, and preparation of GPX/KML data for map-based navigation systems (e.g. OpenStreetMap).

---

## 💡 Purpose

The content is shared as a **reference** collected from long-term professional use.
It is **not** a finished product, framework, or actively maintained application.

The goal is to document practical workflows and data handling patterns in environments where standard car-oriented navigation assumptions do not apply.

## 📜 Contents

- Standalone Python scripts for GPX post-processing (cleaning, merging, renaming, timestamps, metadata)
- Reference datasets (e.g. truck parking locations across Europe)
- Supporting materials related to navigation data preparation

## 📝 Notes

The scripts are intentionally simple and readable.
Users are expected to inspect and run them manually as needed.

No guarantees are provided regarding completeness or future maintenance.
